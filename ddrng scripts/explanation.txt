houi_wheel.ahk
from @houi

This is a wheeler script, to easily wheel any combinations automaticly (with a little tweaking) although it only works with one character on the screen, should work in both fullscreen and windowed.
To use it play as jester and press the key combinations of the desied effect.
Do NOT press any other buttons while its rolling, unless you want to cancel the roll.
DO NOT HOLD THE BUTTONS, this seems to bug out the script and roll a wrong combination.

If the script does not work, try changing the color codes of the icons.
1. just get the color codes with the "get_info.ahk" script as described below. 
2. open the script in your text editor of choice.
3. in the top of the script change the color codes to what you collected in step 1, the color codes in the script looks like this:
;eternia crystal
e_c := 0x05DDFF
;goblin 
gob := 0x242800
;sword
swo := 0x72C1E2
;potion
pot := 0xB90000
;manatoken
man := 0x060030


With no tweaking the active combinations are:
ctrl + f   %dmg all enemies (sword sword sword)
ctrl + t   %heal all alies (potion potion potion)
If you want to use the other combinations, open the code in your text editor of choice and follow the instructions in the big blob of text, starting on line 33.

Tested on
windows operating system
fullscreen (1920x1080)
windowed (all sizes in the dungeon defenders settings)
```

This is a wheeler script, to easily wheel any combinations automaticly (with a little tweaking), should work in both fullscreen and windowed.
to use it start the script whith only one character in the game. ONLY leave and join using the f2-f8 play as jester on the current active player and press the key combinations of the desied effect.
DO NOT PRESS f2-f8 while in a menu or during any other activity that cancels the ingame action of that buttonpress, like a loading screen, this will mess up the script since it tracks the f2-f8 buttons, and you will either have to restart it, or use f7 to leave with all characters.
DO NOT press any other buttons while its rolling, unless you want to cancel the roll.
DO NOT HOLD THE BUTTONS, this seems to bug out the script and roll a wrong combination.

4. save the file
5. reload the script
6. test it!

get_info.ahk

This script is for showing the color code for the pixel the mouse is currently pointing at, and x and y coordinates of that pixel.
This can be used to correct the color codes in the other scripts if they dont work just:
1. start a wheel and roll an icon, do not finnish the wheel.
2. take a screen shot of the icon.
3. hower the mouse over a distinct color of the image.
4. grab the color code.
